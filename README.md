## Election Audit Summary
The script that was used to calculate vote totals and percentages can be used for other elections, with some adjustments. The script imports voter data from all of the counties that participated, as well as the candidates that received votes. To adjust the script for another possible election, data would need to be tracked and imported from all counties and candidates that decide to participate. The script is not limited to having just 3 counties and 3 candidates. It is possible to run another election with more candidates or more counties. Should one candidate drop out of the election, it is possible to have that person's name removed from vote totals. Having a national election with this script is posible. County data in this script would need to be adjusted to state data to determine vote totals from every state.
